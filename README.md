# BudgetTracker
Application that keeps track of a person's finances

(Version 1):

Notes 3/30/2024 - At first I wanted to make this project in java, but I realized that I wanted to have a
front end GUI. I was thinking of learning the needed spring boot, but at the time I was also learning 
web dev, including javascript, so I decided to make it in javascript. I am sure this is going to be a
fun learning experience, since I will get to work with many tools!
